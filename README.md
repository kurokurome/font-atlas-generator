# Font Atlas Generator

This tool processes a font (.ttf & .otf) into an atlas texture of the full ASCII charset, along with the coordinates of each character.

Created to assist in modding/creating RBRHUD Overlays or RBRHUD Gauges.

When the program starts for the first time, two folders will be created:

- `fonts`: To help manage fonts that will be used.
- `outputs`: Where the atlas and coordinates file will be saved after exporting.

## Font Settings

- Font size: 24-150px
- Font Padding size (for each character): 1-10px

## Tips: If you want to use fonts that is installed in your computer, you can copy the fonts you want to use inside `C:\Windows\Fonts` and paste it into `fonts` folder.
